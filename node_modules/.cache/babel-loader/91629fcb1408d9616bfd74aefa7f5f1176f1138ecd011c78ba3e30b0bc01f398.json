When you\\u2019re attacking, being able to destroy parts of the level lets you peek in from odd angles and approach from a side that the enemy team isn't guarding. It also lets you get between areas on the map quickly and in unpredictable ways, helping take the defending team by surprise. On the flip side, if you\\u2019re defending, then opening up the map can help you watch angles that attackers might not see. And since you have some time to set up the site before the attackers get there, you can do it without making too much noise. This lets you adapt to the attackers as well, so if you have a weak side, then try and surprise them. Speaking of which, sound is very important as well. You\\u2019ll need to listen for enemies and for anything they\\u2019re doing, like smashing walls or tearing up floors. Even when attacking, you can sometimes hear where enemies might be hiding, and any little noise they make could win you a round.
