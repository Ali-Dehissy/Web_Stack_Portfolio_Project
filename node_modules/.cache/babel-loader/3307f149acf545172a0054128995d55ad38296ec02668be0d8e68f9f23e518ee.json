When playing your first casual matches, your primary focus should be perfecting your crosshair placementat neck level while walking around trying to find enemies. At this level of play, correctly centering your crosshair and tapping every gun as a semi-auto will get you more kills than you can imagine. During your first CS2 game sessions, don't fear any corner and peek at everyone; you'll get killed a lot initially, but you'll get an authentic feel of how good centering can change the outcome of most gunfights. There are two major mistakes when it comes to centering; the first and most common one is centering too low. Most players will keep their crosshairs at the hip level when checking corners. This will get you killed too many times. Get comfortable checking corners at enemies' neck level to remedy this issue. The other major mistake is centering too close to the wall or corner you're checking. Many players place their crosshairs right on the edge of each corner, leaving them vulnerable to enemies who like to swing wide before shooting. If an enemy goes past your crosshair during a peek, the readjustment will take time, and good players will use it to kill you. Instead of centering right on each edge, place the crosshair a bit away from the corner, where enemies will most likely stop to shoot if they peek.\"\n      }, void 0, false, {\n        fileName: _jsxFileName,\n        lineNumber: 13,\n        columnNumber: 17\n      }, this)]\n    }, void 0, true, {\n      fileName: _jsxFileName,\n      lineNumber: 11,\n      columnNumber: 13\n    }, this), /*#__PURE__*/_jsxDEV(\"div\", {\n      className: \"additional-images\",\n      children: [/*#__PURE__*/_jsxDEV(\"div\", {\n        className: \"image-block\",\n        children: [/*#__PURE__*/_jsxDEV(\"img\", {\n          src: \"/images/valve/counterstrike2guides2.png\",\n          alt: \"How To Control Recoil Properlyends\"\n        }, void 0, false, {\n          fileName: _jsxFileName,\n          lineNumber: 25,\n          columnNumber: 21\n        }, this), /*#__PURE__*/_jsxDEV(\"h3\", {\n          className: \"titleguides\",\n          children: \"How To Control Recoil Properly\"\n        }, void 0, false, {\n          fileName: _jsxFileName,\n          lineNumber: 26,\n          columnNumber: 21\n        }, this), /*#__PURE__*/_jsxDEV(\"p\", {\n          className: \"text\",\n          children: \"To better understand recoil patterns, point your gun at a wall and start shooting; first, check the recoil without moving your mouse.

The first time won't look good, but you'll improve overtime. However, you won't need to hit ten bullets on any target in this game. Practice two-round, three-round, and five-round bursts while waiting for warm-up timers during your casual matches; you'll see great results during actual rounds just by getting those repetitions in. Additionally, try to solve every gunfight by using your practiced bursts for some rounds. This will teach you the maximum viable range for every burst type: five-rounders are for close targets, three-rounders are for medium-range targets, and two-rounders are helpful for long-range firefights. If an enemy is too far away for two-round bursts to be effective, you'll have to tap your mouse to shoot your gun as a semi-automatic, letting it reset after every shot to keep yourself accurate. Slowly, you'll start nailing those headshots from those long ranges. When you understand which burst type is better for every range and if you need to spray or tap to win a gunfight as soon as you see an enemy, you'll feel more confident in every match.
